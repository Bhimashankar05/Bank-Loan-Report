# Bank Loan Data Analysis

I analyzed a dataset related to bank loan data to address challenges like rising default rates and customer retention and performed the following steps:  

1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed the loan dataset structure, analyzed key data types, and identified missing values.    
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats to ensure analysis readiness.   
3. **Key Metrics Calculation**: Calculated important metrics, such as default rates, loan disbursement trends, and customer retention rates.  
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Developed models to predict credit risk, identify high-risk borrowers, and segment profitable customers.  
5. **Visualization**: Designed dashboards using Power BI to visualize loan performance, regional trends, and customer behavior.  
6. **Documentation**: Compiled findings and insights into a clear report, making it ready for use by bank teams and stakeholders.
